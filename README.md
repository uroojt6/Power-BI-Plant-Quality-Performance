The Plant Quality Performance Dashboard in Power BI provides an interactive visualization of key quality metrics within a manufacturing plant. This dashboard enables plant managers, quality engineers, and decision-makers to monitor production quality, identify defects, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

Key Features:
✅ Overall Quality Score – Tracks plant-wide performance with key indicators.
✅ Defect Analysis – Identifies defect types, frequency, and causes.
✅ Production Line Comparison – Compares quality across different production lines.
✅ Yield and Scrap Rate – Analyzes production efficiency and material wastage.
✅ Trend Analysis – Monitors quality trends over time to detect patterns.
✅ Interactive Filtering – Allows users to drill down into specific time periods, machines, or products.
